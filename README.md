## 🎯 Built for Samsung EnnovateX 2025 AI Challenge

Guardio revolutionizes cybersecurity by implementing **adaptive machine learning** that continuously learns individual user behavior patterns. Unlike traditional rule-based security systems, Guardio evolves with users while detecting sophisticated attacks and unauthorized access attempts.

### 🔍 The Problem

- **$5 trillion** in annual fraud losses globally
- Traditional security relies on **static rules** that attackers can bypass
- Current systems can't **adapt** to evolving attack patterns
- **Privacy concerns** with cloud-based behavioral analysis

### 💡 Our Solution

Guardio provides **on-device, adaptive anomaly detection** that:
- ✅ Learns your unique behavioral patterns continuously
- ✅ Detects subtle deviations in real-time
- ✅ Protects privacy with local processing
- ✅ Adapts to natural behavioral changes

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 **Adaptive Intelligence**
- **Continuous Learning**: Exponential moving averages adapt to behavioral changes
- **Multi-Modal Analysis**: Typing patterns, mouse movement, and app usage
- **Statistical Detection**: Z-score based anomaly identification with configurable thresholds

### 🔒 **Privacy-First Design**
- **Local Processing**: All analysis happens on your device
- **No Data Transmission**: Your behavioral data never leaves your computer
- **Zero Cloud Dependency**: Complete offline operation

### 🎛️ **Professional Controls**
- **Live Sensitivity Adjustment**: Real-time threshold tuning (1.0σ to 6.0σ)
- **Alert Cooldown Management**: Prevent notification spam (0-10 seconds)
- **Enterprise Dashboard**: Samsung One UI-inspired interface

### 📊 **Real-Time Monitoring**
- **Risk Score Tracking**: Dynamic security level assessment
- **Typing Speed Analysis**: Live WPM monitoring with performance categorization
- **Agent Status Display**: Transparent system operation visibility

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** installed on your system
- **pip** package manager
- **Linux/Windows/macOS** (cross-platform compatible)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mellowmates/guardio.git
cd guardio

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or install dependencies manually if needed
pip install customtkinter pynput numpy psutil

# Run Guardio
python src/main.py
```

### First Launch

1. **Start Monitoring**: Click "START MONITORING" to begin behavioral learning
2. **Adjust Sensitivity**: Use the slider to set detection threshold (3.0σ recommended)
3. **Set Cooldown**: Configure alert frequency limit (3.0s recommended)
4. **Monitor Activity**: Watch real-time anomaly detection in the activity log

## 🛡️ How It Works

### Behavioral Analysis Engines

| Agent | Analysis Type | Detection Method |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **Movement Agent** | Mouse movement patterns | Velocity and acceleration deviation |
| **Typing Agent** | Keystroke dynamics | Inter-key timing rhythm analysis |
| **AppUsage Agent** | Application behavior | Focus switching and usage patterns |

### Adaptive Learning Process

1. **Profile Initialization**: System learns baseline behavior patterns
2. **Continuous Adaptation**: Exponential moving averages update profiles
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Z-score analysis identifies deviations
4. **Intelligent Alerting**: Configurable thresholds minimize false positives

## 🔧 Configuration

### Sensitivity Settings

```python
# Sensitivity levels (standard deviations)
VERY_SENSITIVE = 1.0  # Detects minor deviations
BALANCED = 3.0        # Recommended default
RELAXED = 6.0         # Only major anomalies
```

### Alert Cooldown


```python
# Cooldown periods (seconds)
IMMEDIATE = 0.0       # No cooldown
BALANCED = 3.0        # Recommended default
MINIMAL_ALERTS = 10.0 # Maximum spacing
```
